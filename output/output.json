C. Alvarez-L\u00f3pez et al.), cigarette smoking leads to the release of extracellular HMGB1 in COPD patients, which contributes to inflammation and tissue remodeling in the airways. HMGB1 is a nuclear protein that is normally confined to the nucleus, but in COPD patients, it is released into the extracellular space due to cell death or active secretion.
