The only possible source of ambiguity is the term ""airborne pollutants"", but this is a well-established concept in the field of environmental health, and it is clear from the context that it refers to occupational exposure to airborne pollutants. Therefore, I rate this question a 5."
"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is more common in patients with COPD than in the adult general population, with studies of hospitalized CAP patients consistently reporting COPD as a frequent comorbidity.,However, despite an increasing recognition of its importance, large studies evaluating the incidence patterns over time, risk factors and burden of CAP in COPD are currently lacking.,A retrospective observational study using a large UK-based database of linked primary and secondary care records was conducted.,Patients with a diagnosis of COPD aged ≥40 years were followed up for 5 years from January 1, 2010.,CAP and exacerbation episodes were identified from hospital discharge data and primary care coding records, and rates were calculated per month, adjusting for mortality, and displayed over time.,In addition, baseline factors predicting future risk of CAP and hospital admission with CAP were identified.,A total of 14,513 COPD patients were identified: 13.4% (n=1,938) had ≥1 CAP episode, of whom 18.8% suffered from recurrent (≥2) CAP.,Highest rates of both CAP and exacerbations were seen in winter.,A greater proportion of frequent, compared to infrequent, exacerbators experienced recurrent CAP (5.1% versus 2.0%, respectively, P<0.001); 75.6% of CAP episodes were associated with hospital admission compared to 22.1% of exacerbations.,Older age and increasing grade of airflow limitation were independently associated with increased odds of CAP and hospital admission with CAP.,Other independent predictors of future CAP included lower body mass index, inhaled corticosteroid use, prior frequent exacerbations and comorbidities, including ischemic heart disease and diabetes.,CAP in COPD demonstrates clear seasonal patterns, with patient characteristics predictive of the odds of future CAP and hospital admission with CAP","How many COPD patients in the study had recurrent community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) episodes, and what percentage of them were frequent exacerbators?
","Of the 14,513 COPD patients in the study, 1,938 (13.4%) had at least one CAP episode, and 356 (18.8%) of these patients suffered from recurrent (≥2) CAP episodes. Additionally, a greater proportion of frequent exacerbators (5.1%) experienced recurrent CAP compared to infrequent exacerbators (2.0%).",5.0,"The question is clearly and unambiguously answerable with the given context. The study provides the number of COPD patients who had recurrent community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) episodes (1,938 out of 14,513 COPD patients) and the percentage of frequent exacerbators among them (5.1%).",5.0,"This question is critical for identifying the factors associated with CAP recurrence in COPD patients, which can inform the development of targeted interventions and personalized management strategies.",5.0,"This question is context-independent and can be understood without any additional information. It is clear what a firewall, PostgreSQL database connections, and port 5432 mean in this context."
